Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: is the branch of computer science that deals with the design,development,testing,and maintenance of software applications(Michigan Tech,n.d).

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development of operation, and maintenance of software,moreover it applies the engineering principles to the software development,focusing on the entire software development life cycle.Software engineering extends beyond traditional programming by incorporating a broader set of principles,methodologies,and practices to ensure the development of high-quality,reliable,and maintainable software system.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the process of developing a software.The SDLC framework involves several steps(i.e Planning,Defining,Designing,Building,Testing and Deployment).The main goal for SDLC is to deliver a high-quality and maintainable results that meet the requirements of the user.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1.Planning and Analysis: the first phase of the SDLC where you gather the requirements of the business from your client and stakeholders.In this phase you also evaluate the feasibility of the creating the product, revenue potential,cost of production,the needs of the users.

2.Defining requirements: This phase converts the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into more concise requiements for the development team. It serves as a guide for the development of several documents such as SRS , Product Specification,a Use Case document,and a Requirement Traceability Matrix document.

3. Design:usually this phase includes the development of a prototype model.The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document that includes the system desigh,programming llanguage,templates,platform to useand application security measures.

4.Development:The development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into a code that makes the product.

5.Testing: The quality assurance team perform validation testing to ensure is is functioning well and meet its expectations.

6.Deployment: The final product is delivered to the user .You can automate this phase and schedule your deployment depending on the type(Hannah,n.d)

7.Maintenance:The final stage of the SDLC depending on the structure that you are following , for an example if you are following the Agile structure then the Maintenance phase is used for furthur improvements. In the maintenance stage users may find bugs which need to be fixed for a better user experience.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile model:It sets the SDLC phases into different development cycles.It is highly efficient ,and due to its rapid development cycle ,it helps tedeveams identify potential issues at an early stage .However overreliance on customer feddback can lead to excessive scope changes.It is best for software development projects that require flexibility and the ability to adapt to change .

Waterfall model: It sets the phases in order (sequentially),with each new phase depending on the outcome of the previous phase .It provides structure for project management,however it provides a small room for changes once the a phase is completed.Therefore it best for a small and well defined projects.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting,and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.The process of requirements engineering includes several stages(Feasibility study,requirements elicitation,requirements specification, requirements for verification and validation, requirements management ).

Requirements enginnering plays a crucial role in software development lifecycle because it helps to ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.It also helps to identify potential issues during the development process.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing software into separate ,independent nodules,each responsible for a distinct functionality.This process isolates functional boundaries ,making it easier to manage and evolve complex systems.

Modularity in software improves the Maintanability and scalability of software systems by :

Maitainability: makes changes in one module to not affect others, making it less complicated to track down and fix bugs without risking the other parts.
Scalability: modular systems can be scaled more readily by adding new modules or improving existing ones without having any impact on the existing one.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Software testing is the process of checking the quality ,functionality,and performanceof a software product before launching.Software testing is essential because it can detect defects that the development team can address abd improve , it maintain and enhance product quality,it also improves customer's trust and satisfaction.

Unit testing: a type of testing that is done on an individual unit in isoltion from the rest of the application.

Integration testing:individual units are combined and tested to ensure that they work well together as expected'

System testing: a type of software testing that tests if the system meets the requirements and suitable for delivery to the end users.

Acceptance testing: a type of testing conducted to evaluate the software application against real life scenarios.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control system is a system that tracks the progress of code across the software development lifecycle and its multiple iterations(Chiradeep,2022).Version control systems are very important as they improve collaboration and communication,acts as a backup and also simplifies code management.Examples of popular version control systems and their features are:

Git:tracks history,free and open source,supports non linear development,scalable,etc
Subversion(Svn):supports atomic commits,keeps a full revision history,supports internationalizes program message ,etc
Mercurial:easy to use,independent,extensible,easy to use,open source ,etc

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Project managers are responsible for ensuring that projects are on track , meet client's needs,and achieve organizational objectives.Projects managers skillfully balance scope ,time,and resources,efficiently allocating assets and preventing budget overruns(Nicholas,2023).Project managers are involved in several categories of software project management which are planning and scope,requirements and analysis phase,resource management,risk management,monitoring and control,quality assurance,stakeholder communication,change management,closusre and evaluation,client satisfaction, and continuous improvement. Some of the challenges faced by prject managers include poor communication,skill gaps,unclear goals ,team conflicts,impractical deadlines,etc.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of modifying, changing, and updating a software system to fix errors ,improve performance or to adapt to a changing environment(Maitray,2023).Maintenance is very crucial in the software lifecycle because it ensures the longevity and success of the software.There are four main different types of software maintenance which are as follows:

1. Adaptive maintenance:in charge of changing software in response to changes in its environment

2. Perfective maintenance: its main objective is to enhance the functionality of the software to improve user experience.

3.Corrective maintenance:responsible for correcting software bugs,errors,and defects

4.Preventive maintenance: it defines the adaptions and modifications of the software that is responsible for mitigating the deterioration risk.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Confidentiality:software engineers should respect and protect the confidential information collect during their proffesional activities.
Conflict of interest:software enginneers should avoid real conflicts
Quality assurance: should always strive to provide high quality service that meets the requirements of your clients.
IEEE code of ethics:software engineers should consider the public when making decisions,such as public safety and welfare, environmental considerations,and public understanding.

in summary"ethics in software engineering is about making decisions that respects user privacy,promote fairness,and benefit the society."
